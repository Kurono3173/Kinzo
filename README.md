# Kinzo
A program of Kinzo (a Umineko no naku koro ni character)

Hi, I'm Crist√≥bal

This is a program that I work in my free time and is about the meme OH DESIRE!, it's just for fun :D

The idea came up when a friend changed the face of several characters from my desktop wallpaper to the face of Kinzo and they
looked very funny.

With the ideas of some friends I was doing some iterations to the program, adding new characteristic like rotating the images,
opening 1 video, then multiples videos from a txt, adding filters to the images, etc.

Special thanks to: Rodrigo, Gabriel and Camilo for the funny ideas
